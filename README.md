In this modern era there have been a lot of cases of ❤️ **Heart Disease** ❤️


Here we have created a `RShiny` application to determine if a particular patient is having a heart disease or not using `Logistic Regression` model. We have used UCI dataset for training our machine learning model acquiring an accuracy of `81.28%` 📈

Check and interact with the application from [here]("https://o61sb6-tavish-gupta.shinyapps.io/Heart_Disease_Prediction"target="_blank").
